title: The Wildlands
---
A land of absolute anarchy, located to the north of [[Jhorasia]]. Stories say that it is full of constantly warring tribes of various monstrous races. Notably, the Wildlands is the location of one of the last battles of the [[Dues Kataklysmos]], so the land has been scarred and deformed. Most tribes here hunt dire beasts, but much more dangerous animals stalk the wilderness. There are tales of an icy barony, full of ancient magic and unexplained phenomena.
