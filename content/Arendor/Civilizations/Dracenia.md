title: Dracenia
---
A hyper-religious state that is build around the [[Platinum Dragon Bahment]]. This civilization was built out of the remnants of a crashed floating city, with the capital, Drakkeon existing as a floating rock in the middle of a bottomless ravine. Dracenia are incredibly xenophobic, and are predominantly made up of the [[Dragonborn]] as well as a sizable population of [[Gnomes]].
