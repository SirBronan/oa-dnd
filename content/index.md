title: Welcome to Arendor
---
Greetings to the Outdoor Adventures Dungeons and Dragon’s database. This project is primarily geared towards new players who need help understanding the lore and content featured in the world of Arendor, as well as classes, races, and more! This is also where I will be taking and uploading notes and relevant information from each session. I haven’t fully figured out the layout of this landing page, but for now I have included character sheets. Enjoy, there will be more coming soon!
